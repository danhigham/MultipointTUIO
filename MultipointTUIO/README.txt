Multi-Point TUIO (Rev 2)
========================

Usage Instructions
==================

Run MTMultimouse.exe and pick your target TUIO app from the window picker. The window picker will disappear and leave a fully transparent window in 
place with a faint red boundary marking where the target app is positioned.

If your target app is buried under other windows then use ctrl+tab to get it back then use it again to bring the "MultiPoint TUIO" window back to 
the very top. Use multiple mice to control your target app. At this point you can even hotplug new mice in and use them too!

Press escape whilst the "Multipoint TUIO" window has focus to close the application.
